#Final Year Project NUTRICARE App

Problem Statement: \
Malnutrition remains a significant challenge, especially in rural areas where access to healthcare 
services is limited. Many parents struggle to identify the early signs of malnutrition, leading to severe 
health issues for their children. Nutricare aims to be a lifeline, offering an accessible tool for early 
detection and personalized nutritional recommendations to help combat this issue.
